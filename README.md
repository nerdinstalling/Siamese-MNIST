# Siamese-MNIST

Siamese network is a neural network that contain two or more identical subnetwork. The objective of this network is to find the similarity or comparing the relationship between two comparable things. Unlike classification task that uses cross entropy as the loss function, siamese network usually uses contrastive loss or triplet loss.

This is a practice of Siamese Network implementation on simple MNIST dataset, trying to represent the handwriting digit images using a two dimensional array.
